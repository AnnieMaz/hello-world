# hello-world
This is my first GitHub project! Wish me luck.
I'm trying to learn a bit more about GitHub, R, and SQL to hone my data analytic/big data skills. 
I also just started working at a tech company and would love to understand what our devs do a bit better.
Fingers crossed this all goes well!
